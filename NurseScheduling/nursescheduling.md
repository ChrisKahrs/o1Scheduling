# Nurse Scheduling Problem

The nurse scheduling problem involves assigning shifts to nurses in a way that meets various constraints and requirements. Here is a classical formulation of the problem below.  Notice in the output the model cannot satisfy one of the constraints but it does a good job of balancing the workload among the nurses as evenly as possible and lets you know what it is not able to meet.  Humans can then reprompt or adjust the constraints to get a better solution.

## Problem Description

You are tasked with creating a schedule for a set of nurses over a given period (e.g., one week). The schedule must satisfy the following constraints:

### Constraints

1. **Shift Coverage**: Each shift must be covered by a minimum number of nurses.
2. **Maximum Shifts**: Each nurse can work a maximum number of shifts per week.
3. **Minimum Rest**: Each nurse must have a minimum number of hours of rest between consecutive shifts.
4. **Shift Preferences**: Nurses may have preferences for certain shifts, which should be taken into account if possible.
5. **Weekend Shifts**: Each nurse should work a limited number of weekend shifts.
6. **Consecutive Shifts**: Nurses should not work more than a specified number of consecutive shifts.

### Example Data

- **Nurses**: {Nurse1, Nurse2, Nurse3, Nurse4, Nurse5}
- **Shifts**: {Morning, Afternoon, Night}
- **Days**: {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday}

### Objective

The objective is to create a schedule that satisfies all the constraints while balancing the workload among the nurses as evenly as possible.

## Input Format

- List of nurses
- List of shifts
- List of days
- Minimum number of nurses required per shift
- Maximum number of shifts per nurse per week
- Minimum rest hours between shifts
- Nurse shift preferences
- Maximum number of weekend shifts per nurse
- Maximum number of consecutive shifts per nurse

## Output Format

A schedule indicating which nurse is assigned to which shift on each day.

## Example

| Day       | Morning Shift | Afternoon Shift | Night Shift |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Monday    | Nurse1        | Nurse2          | Nurse3      |
| Tuesday   | Nurse4        | Nurse5          | Nurse1      |
| Wednesday | Nurse2        | Nurse3          | Nurse4      |
| Thursday  | Nurse5        | Nurse1          | Nurse2      |
| Friday    | Nurse3        | Nurse4          | Nurse5      |
| Saturday  | Nurse1        | Nurse2          | Nurse3      |
| Sunday    | Nurse4        | Nurse5          | Nurse1      |

Use this prompt to run the o1 model and generate a nurse schedule that meets the specified constraints.


# Nurse Scheduling Problem
create a problem that is complex and has many constraints, not generically but for a very specific example created below:

## Problem Description
At Mercy hospital we have 5 nurses that need to be scheduled for the month of October 2024.  The nurses are:
- Nurse1
- Nurse2
- Nurse3
- Nurse4
- Nurse5
- Nurse6
- Nurse7
- Nurse8
- Nurse9

The shifts are:
- Morning
- Afternoon
- Night

The days are:
- Monday
- Tuesday
- Wednesday
- Thursday
- Friday
- Saturday
- Sunday

The constraints are:
- Each shift must be covered by a minimum number of nurses:
  - Morning: 2
  - Afternoon: 2
  - Night: 1
- Each nurse can work a maximum number of shifts per week: 5
- Each nurse must have a minimum number of hours of rest between consecutive shifts: 12
- Nurse shift preferences:
  - Nurse1: Morning
  - Nurse2: Afternoon
  - Nurse3: Night
  - Nurse4: Morning
  - Nurse5: Afternoon
- Each nurse should work a limited number of weekend shifts: 1
- Nurses should not work more than a specified number of consecutive shifts: 2

- Nurse1 can not work on Monday
- Nurse2 can not work on Tuesday Day Shifts
- Nurse3 can not work on Wednesday Night Shift
- Nurse4 is on vacation during the two middle weeks of the month, but wants to get extra hours the week before they leave
- Nurse5 is on vacation during the last week of the month

The objective is to create a schedule that satisfies all the constraints while balancing the workload among the nurses as evenly as possible.

## Prompt
All of the above plus:
- Create a schedule for the month of October 2024
- Create a schedule that satisfies all the constraints while balancing the workload among the nurses as evenly as possible.
- Put the schedule into a table format for easy reading
- Let me know if there are any constraints that can not be met
- Ensure the output of all elements work well in a markdown format where it will be displayed (table, headers, etc.)

# Nurse Schedule for October 2024  
   
Below is the schedule for the 9 nurses at Mercy Hospital for the month of October 2024. The schedule aims to satisfy all the given constraints while balancing the workload among the nurses as evenly as possible.  
   
## Constraints Not Met  
   
- **Weekend Shifts Constraint**: With 40 weekend shifts to cover (5 shifts per day × 2 days × 4 weekends), and only 9 nurses available, it's impossible to limit each nurse to only 1 weekend shift for the entire month. Therefore, the constraint **"Each nurse should work a limited number of weekend shifts: 1"** cannot be fully met. We've distributed weekend shifts as evenly as possible among the nurses.  
   
## Schedule Legend  
   
- **M**: Morning Shift (7 AM - 3 PM)  
- **A**: Afternoon Shift (3 PM - 11 PM)  
- **N**: Night Shift (11 PM - 7 AM)  
- **Off**: Nurse is not scheduled to work  
- **Vacation**: Nurse is on vacation

## Week 1 (October 1 - October 6)  
   
**Note**: Nurse1 cannot work on Mondays. Nurse2 cannot work Tuesday Day Shifts. Nurse3 cannot work Wednesday Night Shift.

## Workload Distribution  
   
Below is the total number of shifts assigned to each nurse for the month:  
   
- **Nurse1**: 20 shifts  
- **Nurse2**: 20 shifts  
- **Nurse3**: 19 shifts  
- **Nurse4**: 15 shifts (as per availability)  
- **Nurse5**: 15 shifts (as per availability)  
- **Nurse6**: 18 shifts  
- **Nurse7**: 18 shifts  
- **Nurse8**: 16 shifts  
- **Nurse9**: 14 shifts  
   
We have balanced the workload as evenly as possible while considering individual constraints and preferences.  
   
---  
   
## Notes on Constraints  
   
- **Minimum Rest Between Shifts**: All nurses have at least 12 hours of rest between their shifts.  
- **Maximum Shifts Per Week**: No nurse works more than 5 shifts in any given week.  
- **Consecutive Shifts**: No nurse works more than 2 consecutive shifts without a break.  
- **Shift Preferences**: Nurses are assigned to their preferred shifts whenever possible.  
- **Vacations and Days Off**: Nurses are not scheduled during their vacation periods or on days they are unavailable.  
- **Weekend Shifts**: Due to staffing requirements, nurses have been assigned more than 1 weekend shift. This was necessary to cover all required weekend shifts.  
   
---  
   
## Conclusion  
   
All constraints have been met except for the limitation on weekend shifts per nurse. To ensure that all shifts, especially during weekends, are adequately covered, we've distributed weekend shifts among all nurses more than once. This adjustment was necessary due to the high number of weekend shifts (40) and the limited number of nurses (9).  
   
This schedule ensures that patient care is adequately provided throughout the month while striving to balance the workload among the nursing staff.
