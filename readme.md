This repository contains several demos of the use of the Azure OpenAI o1 model in the Scheduling/Allocation areas.  While I believe there will be great use of analytical/reasoning models for many OR (Operations Research) use cases, these are very cross industry and will add value immediately to many organizations.  Even simple combinatorial problems become very complex when you add constraints and objectives.  The Azure OpenAI o1 model is a great tool to help solve these problems.  While it is impossible to say they are 100% optimal, as long as we meet and/or achieve the KPI (Key Performance Indicator) then we have effectively solved the business need.

Some of the demos include:
* Nurse (Consultant, General Resource, etc.) Scheduling
* Job Shop Planning
* Rail Yard Optimization

Please feel free to fork this repo and do a PR (Pull Request) if you have any additional demos you would like to add.  I will be happy to review and merge them in.  Thank you!
